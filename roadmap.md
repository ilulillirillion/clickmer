# Concepts

## Death and injury

HP hitting zero should not be the most common way to die, death should be
caused by more specific triggers related to damage sustained, and HP should be
used as a complimentary system.

# Game world

## Map

### x axis
Status: Implemented
Description: Cartesian abscissa axis for lateral tracking.

### y axis
Status: Implemented
Description: Cartesian ordinate axis for longitudinal tracking.

### z axis
Status: Todo
Description: Cartesian applicate axis for vertical tracing.

### w axis
Status: Idea
Description: Custom Cartesian axis for tracking entities that move outside of normally accessible spatial axis. Used as an alternative to "ephemeral" state tagging, entities that phase in and out will still occupy x, y and z coordinate values but will be offset by a w coordinate, indicating their disassociation from conventional tangibility.

## Generation

Generate a chunk of land for each player that is theirs. The player can buy more land where none has been generated, on the "frontier", or from other players. Can take from players by force?

Allow players supernatural sorts of influence over their realms?

## Systems

### Energy

Use energy to do actions, refill with food?

# Object structure

## Client Side

### Classes

#### Thing
##### Description
Base class that most objects should extend.
##### Status
Implemented

### Mixins

#### Tangible 
##### Description
Objects that can be interacted with.
Maybe not needed, could represent ephemeral objects with a hidden axis?
##### Status
Archived

#### Spatial 
##### Description
Extends objects to occupy locations in space.
##### Status
Implemented

#### CanWinstonLog 
##### Description
Extends objects with an interface for logging to a Winston logger instance.

#### CanConsoleLog 
##### Description
Extends objects with an interface to log to the console.
##### Status
Implemented

#### ServerManaged 
##### Description
Extends objects with an update function for server overwritability.
##### Status
Implemented
##### Notes
Considering reducing this, since this really just provides an update method
for properties to be overriden, it is just managed and has nothing to do with
a server in theory.

#### Vagile 
##### Description
Extends objects so that they can move on their own.
##### Status
Implemented

#### Drawable 
##### Description
Extends objects so they can be drawn by map objects.
##### Dependencies
- Spatial Mixin
##### Status
Implemented

#### KeyboardControllable
##### Description
##### Dependencies
- Movable
##### Status

for v 0.01: Want working player registration and loading

- grab username at login and use it to load a player.
- io.on('connection) should be handled outside of the game object.
- mysql curry functions have try catch pattern, use monad
- log filename and line number in winston


---


- Add classgroups, to avoid redundant imports. For example, instead of import ActorStatistic, ActorSkill, and ActorCharacteristics, roll them up somehow into one object because they inter-import each other already.

- Add a decorator to time functions for performance metrics.
  - wrote the decorator, but looks like es7 does not currently support them.

- Add tick per second graphic

- Adopt MVC model
  - code switch for model which will allow it to run locally

  vitality:
    determines how much health the actor will have.

  insight:
    "see the world as it really is", shows hidden things. Generally positive although can have some negative consequences. In general, will make the learner more vulnerable to effects like lunacy.

  lunacy:
    A specific type of madness caused by the moon. Can have some beneficial effects but is largely detrimental, particularly at higher amounts.
