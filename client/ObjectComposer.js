/**
 *  Provides the ObjectComposer function.
 *  The ObjectComposer composes objects from mixins with some capacity for
 *  managing the mixin process through parameters.
 *
 *  Example Usage:
 *    // First, build a mixin by currying half of the objecting composer.
 *    const examplePrivateMethod = Symbol('examplePrivateMethod');
 *    const ExampleMixin = ObjectComposer('example_imported_property')({
 *      // Any normal class method, will be public.
 *      examplePublicMethod() {
 *        console.log(this.example_imported_property);
 *      },
 *      examplePublicMethodToOverride() {
 *        console.log('This should have been overridden.');
 *      },
 *      // Any normal class method, will be private due to being bound to a
 *      // symbol.
 *      // Symbols are ignored on enumeration so bypass the object composer.
 *      // This property can't be exported even if explictly asked for.
 *      [examplePrivateMethod](example_parameter) {
 *        console.log('I should not be accessible.');
 *      }
 *    });
 *
 *    // Should override a method from the first mixin.
 *    const ExampleMixinOverride = ObjectComposer()({
 *      examplePublicMethodToOverride() {
 *        console.log('Override success.');
 *      }
 *    });
 *
 *    const ExampleClass =
 *        // Wrap everything around the example override mixin.
 *        ExampleMixinOverride
 *          // Export properties.
 *          ( 'examplePublicMethodToOverride' )
 *          // Exotic export properties.
 *          ()
 *          // Wrap everything around the example mixin.
 *          ( ExampleMixin
 *            // Export properties.
 *            ( 'examplePublicMethod',
 *              'examplePublicMethodToOverride',
 *              'examplePublicMethodForExoticOverride'
 *            )
 *            // Exotic export properties.
 *            ()
 *            // Wrap everything around a base class.
 *            ( class {
 *      constructor(example_imported_property="foo") {
 *        console.log('Running example class constructor:', example_imported_property);
 *        this.example_imported_property = example_imported_property;
 *      }
 *    }));
 *
 *    let example_class = new ExampleClass('foo');
 *    example_class.examplePublicMethod();  //  =>  'foo'
 *    console.log('Got example class:', example_class);
 *
 *    example_class.example_imported_property = 'bar';
 *    console.log('Mutated example class:', example_class);
 *    example_class.examplePublicMethod();  //  =>  'bar'
 *
 *    // Should fail.
 *    try {
 *      example_class.examplePrivateMethod();
 *      console.warn('Private method was accessed!');
 *    } catch {}
 *
 *    example_class.examplePublicMethodToOverride();  
 *    //  =>  'Override success.'
