=== Clickmer - An underwater civilization clicker ===


game order:
  start out as a particularly smart octopus near a coral reef

  can search for a den

  searching for a den has a random chance of finding a cave dwelling

  once in cave dwelling, the first tasks appear:
    'hunt crustaceans'
      increments the hunger stat of the worker
    'explore surroundings'
      random chance to discover:
        clambed
          harvest clams:
            will increase food stores. If food stores are undiscovered then
            discovers them. Also undiscovers the clambed
          study clams:
            slowly increases research towards clam farms


technologies:
  food storage:
    points: 1
    discovered by triggering an action that would result in storing food


mechanics:
- each octopus has stats:
  - hunger:
    - usually invisible to the player, except when an octopus is starving
      in which case an alert will appear in the hud


rough ideas:
  - display hunger and stats in pop menu
  - randomly generate octo pixel art and name
  - skill system
