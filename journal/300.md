### Commit 300
#### Finish object composer, extensive roadmapping

Finally finished (at least on appearance) the object composer, and tested some
implementation for composing basic classes.
A large part of this commit is brand new roadmapping documentation. Technical
development has halted until I can more extensively plan what I'm attempting to
build, though I hope to resume that work soon.
