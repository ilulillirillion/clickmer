### Commit 287
#### Trigger actions on console custom keyword input

Adds a "console" object to the main declarations and uses a giant if/else to catch the console input and execute a mapped command. Right now the following are available:

- `regenerate_tiles`: Recreates all of the map tiles.
- `logger_level_debug`: Sets log level to debug.
- `logger_level_info`: Sets log level to info.
- `logger_level_warn`: Sets log level to warn.
- `logger_level_error`: Sets log level to error.
- `logger_level_critical`: Sets log level to critical.
- `nolog`: Also sets log level to critical.

Also, the map no longer generates tiles on game startup. The game assumes that tiles are already created and waits for the admin to manually regenerate tiles with console if needed. Will consider adding in better logic so that the map will proactively recreate itself if certain conditions are met.
