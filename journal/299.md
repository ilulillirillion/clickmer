#### Hone object composer, add roadmap brainstorming

Object composer is now essentially complete. It still needs to be thoroughly
tested, which I imagine I will get plenty of when porting over the existing
class code, and it also needs to be made able to handle and mutate return
values.

Adds some brainstorming documents which may or may not become a part of actual
implementation.
