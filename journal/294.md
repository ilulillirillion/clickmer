### Commit 294
#### Continue refactoring and compositionalizing

Significant progress on the ongoing refactor. Certain functions have been moved
into class mixins to provide more compositionality, and more elements have been
moved to a rudimentary custom library.
Most client and server objects should have their own interfaces for
communicating to their respective loggers, which should allow for logger
customization at the object level.
