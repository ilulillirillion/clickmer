### Commit 291
#### WIP refactor of client/server state handling

A mid-way checkpoint of refactoring the client/server state code.
Map rendering and movement are currently broken.
Uses a new client object that updates its state from the server.
Plan to remove x_delta and y_delta and have client directly update its x and y.
The server will eventually run a function on its end to determine if clients
proposed x and y are valid and until then should just accept the proposed
values.
