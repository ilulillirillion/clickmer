### Commit 290
#### Notably refactor client main, organize classes

Lifts a lot of code out of the player main file into dedicated class files.
Player now has a concept of an x_delta and y_delta, which represent the position difference in position the client has from it's last update from the server. On tick, the client sends this data to the server to be recorded before resetting the values.

As of right now player position is still authoritative and the server blindly takes and applies the delta.
