### Commit 293
#### Cleaning up and refactoring code.

Progress has been a little slower but has not halted the last couple of days,
another refactor has been going on behind the scenes that might be ready for
committing later today.

So far the improvements have continued to focus on client code and now include
better documentation and logging, some reorganization and is continuing to
benefit from the removal of deprecated code. Some lines are also being cleaned
up if they were violating some standard that I usually try to keep.

Added a new library directory, which contains generic modules that should be
portable beyond the project itself. These files may utlimately be converted
into an actual custom library but for now it is purely organizational. Lot's
of existing code could probably be moved partially to this new library, but
I'm not sure if that will ultimately be a part of this current refactor or not.

A new item as of the time of this journal that has been added into the library
is a generic mixin that provides the ability to log to a browser-provided
console using wrappers around the native functions, which has allowed togglable
logging and could provide further improvements in the future.
