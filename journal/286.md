#### Save map to database; build tiles on client

Map tiles are now generated on startup and stored in a MySQL database.
On tick, the game gathers player surroundings and sends them to each player so they can create and draw tiles, reducing workload on the server.

The performance boost has been night and day, especially since this increasing the map size to 1000x1000. Overall we've gone from 23-25 seconds ticks before the player surroundings system, to about 10 seconds to tick before offloading map tiles to SQL, to 75ms ticks with a client connected. Also, saving the map tiles as SQL data took world gen from over 2 minutes to just over 30 seconds.
