        Mainly used to surround the necropolis and give the player options to
        conquer easy surrounding tiles early on. At first, foraging is not very
        useful because the eldritch artifacts nor the darkstone provided by the
        eldritch_rubble can do anything on their own without more advanced
        technology.
