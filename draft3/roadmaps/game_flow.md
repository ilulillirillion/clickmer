## Summon a skeleton
### Get 100 bones
Bones will accrue over time via the "mysterious bones" effect of the eternal icon. In normal play this should take 100 ticks from the start of the game.
### Get 2 energy
The big challenge to summoning a skeleton is increasing maximum energy to 2.
Fill up the energy meter and power up 10 times in order to double your starting energy cap to 2, then simply refill to the new maximum.
### Summon skeleton
With 100 bones and 2 energy, simply interact with the eternal icon and select raise skeleton.

# Game Flow (2)

## Game Start
See starting state roadmap.

## Summon First Wisp
### Summon Wisp
With a single energy and at least 1 power, interact with the eternal icon and select "raise with wisp", this will cost one energy and consume 1 power while it exists.
## Start Gathering Materials
### Scout the Eldritch Necropolis Twice
You can start foraging to gather bones right away, but, especially since you'll have to scout the Eldritch Necropolis at least once soon anyway, it makes more sense to scout it twice now. The first scout will provide "perimeter" which will expose the surrounding tiles and will be useful shortly. The second scout will provide "familiar terrain" which increases forageables gathered from the tile by 50%, and is the reason it is more efficient to scout now rather than later.
### Start Gathering Bones
You'll want to start gathering bones in order to be prepared to summon a skeleton as soon as possible, so it's best to have the first wisp start foraging on the eldritch necropolis, where the eldritch rubble will provide a small amount of bones.
## Summon Second Wisp
Gathering enough bones for a skeleton is a very slow process with just one wisp, you can double the speed relatively easily by summoning another.
### Get 1 Power
With one wisp summoned, you will need to get another power available before summoning a second. Conventionally, you could get back to 1 power by powering up at the eternal icon, but it will take a very long time. The best thing to do at the start is to buy the one-time power ritual which costs just one energy.
### Summon Wisp
Summon the second wisp just as before -- it will have the same cost.
Once summoned, set the wisp to assist with foraging the eldritch necropolis to speed up bone gathering.
## Summon Third Wisp
You can get by with 2 wisps, but since you won't have much else to do while your other 2 are foraging, it is feasible to get a third going, by powering up with 1 energy or more 10 times, bring your total energy up to 2, and purchasing the second rank of the summon power ritual at the eternal icon, which will give you a 3rd power to use for summoning a wisp.
This is still much faster than powering up directly, as, at 1 energy per power up, it would take 100 power ups to get a full 1 energy.
## Conquer a Tile
The third wisp won't be able to forage concurrently on the eldritch necropolis due to the eldritch rubble only having 2 forage slots. 
The best thing to do is to have the free wisp conquer a new tile.
### OPTIONAL: Scout the Eldritch Necropolis (if not already scouted)
Select "Scout" on the Eldritch Necropolis and select the idle wisp.
Once complete, the surrounding hexes will be visible and interactable, but still will need to be conquered to unlock full interaction.
### Fight for a Tile
Select "destroy" on one of the revealed adjacent tiles (all of them should be overgrown graveyards) and assign the idle wisp to destroy the "ancient burial". Wisps are generally not very good at combat, but the ancient burials only generate spirits, which are harmlesss to shades and can be damaged by them, even though the wisp will be very slow at destroying the ancient burial. You should destroy the ancient burial on your first try, as the spirits won't be able to damage the wisp.
## Summon a Skeleton
Skeletons sort of suck, but wisps _really_ suck, especially for fighting anything that's not a spirit, so next step is to get a skeleton.
### Get 100 bones
At the current base accruement of bones from foraging, this is expected to take 1000 ticks with a single wisp, 500 with two, and 333 with 3. You can keep a wisp free to continue conquering tiles, but since all you can do at this point with the graveyards is forage bones, it's more worthwhile to use all of your workers on foraging unless you run out of slots.
### Summon Skeleton
With 100 bones and at least 1 power, you can summon the skeleton at the eternal icon. If you are out of power and can't get enough quickly, it's fine to sacrifice a wisp, you'll be replacing them all with skeletons anyway.
## Conquer New Tile
At this point, the goal is to get more land. Wisps can technically fight, but they are so abyssmal that it's not worth trying (wisps can be used effectivey in combat, but only in very unique situations), so you will want to use skeletons for this task.
### Scout an Ancient Gravescape
Scout one of the ancient gravescape tiles

Skeletons are better at foraging than wisps, but wisps scout just as quickly. It's most efficient to send a wisp that was foraging to scout the tile and have the skeleton forage so you can get more bones.
