# Tile-based inventory
- Inventory is, in general, tile-based.
- Earliest way to swap items is to assign a worker to transfer it, but this must be done item by item (single quantity), tile by tile. Liquids cannot be transferred.
- Once liquid storage tech is available, liquids can be transferred.
- Once roads are available and built, tiles with roads on each end can dramatically increase transfer rate. 
- Once central storage systems can be built, the player can largely automate transferring items using workers.
