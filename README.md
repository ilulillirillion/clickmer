0v0.0.0.0 - Reverting push towards functional programming because of performance concerns. The effort was not wasted as I learned a lot and even improved my asynchronous JS understanding.

Great things I've learned from:
  - https://codeshack.io/basic-login-system-nodejs-express-mysql/
    Currently using this to figure out a basic authentication system.
  - https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-browser-game-4a793818c29b
    Used this as a launching point to learn how to build an express server and app.
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/ahf6nx/how_to_make_an_incremental_game/
    Great tutorial for simple idle game mechanics and helped me get back into Javascript.
