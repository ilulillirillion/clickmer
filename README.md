Great things I've learned from:
  - https://codeshack.io/basic-login-system-nodejs-express-mysql/
    Currently using this to figure out a basic authentication system.
  - https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-browser-game-4a793818c29b
    Used this as a launching point to learn how to build an express server and app.
