1. Game start (see starting game state)

2. Click and hold the "influence" button on the forest tile until a hominid is enthralled (Can also enthrall a hominid on the caverns tile, but will lose influence or starve them as there will be no way to forage for food).

3. Forage on the forest tile for enough fruit to sustain the thrall while the primitive religious markings are created.

4. Build the primitive religious markings, then return to foraging for fruit.

5. Click and hold the "influence" button on the forest tile until a second orc is enthralled

1. Game start (see starting game state)

2. Click and hold the "increase strength" button on the "eldritch necropolis" until you have enough energy to raise a servant.

3. Click the "raise servant" button on the "eldritch necropolis" tile to start raising a new servant. If the servant is lost for any reason beyond this step you, repeat steps 2-3 to regain a servant.

4. Order the servant to explore a surrounding overgrown forest tile.

5. Fight for the overgrown forest tile using the servant. If the servant dies, get a new one and resume fighting until the tile is yours.

6. Construct "primitive religious markings" within the overgrown forest to get a new servant slot.

7. Trap a chipanzee on the overgrown forest tile

8. Click on the chipanzee in the tile inventory, and transfer it to the eldritch necropolis.

9. Don't sacrifice the chimpanzee for bonuses, instead, click and hold to convert it into a servant.

10. Leave the chimpanzee at the eldritch necropolis and set it to worship, in order to automate and speed up gaining strength

11. While the chimpanzee worships (undead servants cannot worship) in the necropolis, set the skeleton to forage in the overgrown forest in order to gain fruit to feed the chimpanzee. Make sure to transfer fruit over to the eldritch necropolis. You can move the chimpanzee to the overgrown forest and have it worship at the primitive religious markings but to avoid needing to transfer fruit but it will slow down gaining strength.

12. Gain strength until you can get a 3rd servant, which you should use to get another overgrown forest.

13. Build primitive religious markings on the new overgrown forest, this will increase strength but probably not unlock a new servant slot right away due to the strength curve.

14. At this point you should have a skeleton foraging (skeletons can do this 24/7), a chimpanzee doing worship, and a skeleton doing combat for one of the river tiles nearby. If you don't see any rivers, capture another overgrown forest, or sacrifice a servant to "scout an area", which will allow you to see all adjacent areas (gate this behind a tech?).

15. Once you have a river tile, move a non-skeletal servant there and have them research oldawan manufacturing. Since you will be using a chimpanzee it will take quite a while.

16. Once you h
